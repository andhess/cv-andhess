I originally forked this repo from [Philip Thomas](https://github.com/philipithomas), a friend of mine at Washington University in St. Louis.  I have completely re-written it, but have kept the original bootstrap style and formatting.

#My Modifications
Philip had written functions for each project, position, skill, and honor in php. I have redone all of them in javascript.  Since the browser is now rendering all the content, it can now be statically served with something like S3. I'm not sure how much faster it will be, but it does eliminate the need for a php server.

#About
Paper resumes suck. They are inconvenient to carry around. They are boring to read. There are always multiple versions. 

I decided to turn my resume into a website to address these concerns. This makes the site easy to access, and it allows linking to various projects. The site is based on the [Spacelab Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), so design is responsive. Storing the site as a public git repository allows version control and a degree of accountability as changes are made.
